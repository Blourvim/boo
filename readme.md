# Boo! ðŸ‘»

A spooky TCP [quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing))ish that prints its own source code kind of (and ASCII ghost) when visited.

It is not very polished but a fun midnight project regardless

This is also a [polyglot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot_(computing))

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:Blourvim/boo.git
