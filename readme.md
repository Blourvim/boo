# Boo! ðŸ‘»

A spooky TCP quine(ish) that prints its own source code kind of (and ASCII skull) when visited. It is not very polished but a fun midnight project regardless


## Usage

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:Blourvim/boo.git
cd boo

# Run the server
cargo run

# Visit in your browser or with curl
curl localhost:8001
